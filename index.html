    <h1>About Me!</h1>
    
        <h3>My name is Amy Li</h3>
        <p>I was born on August 10, 2008 and I am currently 15 years old. I attend Staten Island Technical Highschool and am in my sophmore year. In my free time, I enjoy playing volleyball, listening to music, and hanging out with my friends. I love all types of animals; I find them very cute! However, I hate bugs and insects, espically cockroaches. I have many favorite foods such as sushi, pho, ramen and much more! Furthermore, my favorite fast food resturant is chipotle. I've eaten chipotle so many times but I still can never get tired of it. My order is a salad with brown rice, chicken, corn salsa, mild salsa, guac, and chipotle vinaigrette!</p>
